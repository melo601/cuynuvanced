This repository has been go through 4 stages, from March 14, 2022 to now :

Stage 1 :
On March 13, 2022, Team Vanced announced they discontinued Vanced, after a few hours, I created this ytvanced repository whose purpose is to "archive" the last Vanced version 17.03.38 (that version is still in my repository), then nothing else for Vanced such as updates because i'm not a developer until July of 2022

Stage 2 :
When inotia00 serialized Vanced to Vanced Extended, there were newer versions of Vanced available, I also took several versions of inotia00 and packaged it into an apk, then released it at this repository (you still can find released vanced inotia00 build in my releases), i re-released 17.28.34 as apk was the first version of inotia00 that i release, then some time later inotia00 said 17.33.42 was the last version of Vanced Extended and will no more newer version. Yes, I also release that 17.33.42 version as apk. After that, all activities on this repository are stopped until October of 2022.

Stage 3 : 
At this stage i don't know if another version of Vanced can be found because inotia00 has also stopped Vanced Extended and switched to ReVanced Extended, At that time, I thought if I should try to build ReVanced, then change its icon to Vanced and then release it here, I don't think after release it, many people will like it, because i know so many people are enjoying ReVanced and doesn't care about Vanced, i only release it for fun. But no, many people knew about my release at that time. At me I was very happy because I felt people were interested in it (first initial released build is 17.41.34, its still in my release) I gradually continued to use ReVanced Extended to update it to higher versions eg 17.42.33, 17.45.34, 17.45.36. Everything is fine because most people don't know it's based on ReVanced Extended at this time, But after I created the update and discussion group, and my repository became more popular, many people dived into the apk and found out that it was just a "forks" of ReVanced Extended. after that, many people were know my builds only is the ReVanced Extended forks. I persisted and tried to update to 18.01.38 and last is 18.02.33 hotfix, Then on January 29, I announced the news that i will temporarily stop Vanced to make vanced-patches, all new updates have been stopped from 29 January till now because i was so sad...

Stage 4 :
After a while (About 3 months), I decided to do my best to make my own patch 18.17.36 vanced, however it requires a high level of developer, I'm still trying day by day,and if I succeed, I will continue to update Vanced with my own patch, and even invite ReVanced admins to collaborate. Hope you will support me, thanks.
